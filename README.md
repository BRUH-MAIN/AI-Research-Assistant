# Scientific Literature Mining with LLMs

This project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to contextually mine scientific literature and extract structured data through strategic prompting and reasoning techniques.

## 🧠 Objective

Deploy contextual capabilities of LLMs (e.g., few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning) to extract relevant information from scientific texts.

## 🔍 Workflow

**Input**: Published scientific literature (textual corpus)

**Processing**:

* Few-shot prompting with LLMs
* Chain-of-thought reasoning

**Output**: Clean, tabulated dataset with extracted insights

## 📦 Output

A structured dataset representing distilled, domain-relevant information from unstructured literature.

## 🚧 Status

**In progress** – Initial framework and pipeline setup underway.
